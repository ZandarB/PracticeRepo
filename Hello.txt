Hello!

Hello!

How are you?

How are you?

I asked you first.

I asked you first.

That's really mature, saying exactly what I say!

Mature...exactly...what I say....

I'm an idiot!

You're an idiot!

All right, fine.

I'm not talking to you anymore. In fact, I'm going to whisper.

So that by the time my voice reverberates off the walls and gets back to me I won't be able to hear it!

You're an idiot!
